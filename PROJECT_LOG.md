## Current Goal

**All Phase 1 MVP tasks complete.**  

**Immediate objective:** Run `docker-compose up` → apply seed data → end-to-end test booking flow

---

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Monorepo structure | `apps/` + `services/` + `packages/` + `infrastructure/` | Clear separation of frontend, backend, shared, infra |
| Backend language | Go (search/financing/iot), Java Spring Boot (WMS), Python (AI) | Matches blueprint spec exactly |
| Mobile app | React Native (cross-platform) | MVP speed; blueprint specified Kotlin for prod but RN covers both platforms faster |
| API style | gRPC inter-service, REST for clients | Blueprint spec: gRPC + protobuf internally, REST externally |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS 3.4 | Geo-spatial warehouse matching; blueprint mandated |
| Cache | Redis 7 | Session, inventory lock, double-booking prevention |
| Search | Elasticsearch 8 | Multi-variable warehouse search |
| Events | Apache Kafka | IoT telemetry, inventory events, booking state changes |
| Auth | JWT (MVP) → Keycloak (Phase 2) | JWT simple for MVP; Keycloak for RBAC in Phase 2 |
| Pricing formula | `P = P_base × (1 + α(U - U*) + β×V)` | From blueprint matching engine spec (Part 9) |
| Matching score | `S = w1×D + w2×P + w3×Q + w4×T` | Blueprint recommendation score formula (Part 9) |

## Roadblocks & Open Questions

| # | Blocker | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mapbox API key needed for interactive map | 🟡 Pending | Placeholder in env — user needs to add `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` |
| 2 | WDRA / NERL / CCRL API credentials | 🟡 Pending | Stubbed in financing service — real creds needed for Phase 2 |
| 3 | Go not pre-installed on machine | ✅ Resolved | Installed via `brew install go` |
| 4 | RuuviTag / GasSense SDK access | 🟡 Pending | IoT gateway uses simulated payloads in dev; real SDK in Phase 2 |
| 5 | WhatsApp Business API key (AI chatbot) | 🟡 Pending | Stubbed — needs Meta Business account |

---

## Next Steps (Phase 1 → Phase 2 Hardening)

1. **[NEXT]** `docker-compose up` → verify all 5 microservices healthy + seed data loads
2. **[NEXT]** Add real Mapbox token (`VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN`) to `.env` for web portal testing
3. **[NEXT]** Register WDRA API credentials and NERL repository access for financing service
4. **[NEXT]** Set up WhatsApp Business API for OTP delivery (replace console log stub)
5. **[NEXT]** Deploy to AWS EKS using `infrastructure/k8s/` manifests (Phase 2 kickoff)

---

## Context Checkpoint

### Assumptions Made
- **React Native over Kotlin for MVP:** Blueprint specified Kotlin for Android prod app, but RN is faster for a solo MVP. Decision is reversible — same API contract.
- **JWT for auth in MVP:** Blueprint specified Keycloak/Okta for RBAC. JWT tokens are sufficient for Phase 1 single-tenant pilot. Keycloak added in Phase 2.
- **Stub external APIs:** NERL, CCRL, WDRA, WhatsApp, Mapbox — all need real keys. Services are wired but use environment-variable-gated stubs when keys absent.
- **Single Postgres instance for MVP:** Blueprint shows RDS with read replicas. Local dev uses single Docker Postgres; production will use managed RDS.
- **Python FastAPI for AI:** Blueprint specified serverless Lambda for AI inference. FastAPI container is simpler for MVP; Lambda deployment layer added in Phase 2.
- **Phase 1 geo focus:** Agra / Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh — seed data reflects this.

### Key Business Rules Encoded
- Marketplace commission: **15%** on all storage bookings
- Logistics dispatch fee: **8%** of shipping route cost
- e-NWR loan origination fee: **1.5%**
- Cargo insurance commission: **20%**
- Target warehouse utilization: **85%** (U* in pricing formula)
- Dynamic pricing elasticity: Price increases when occupancy > 85%, decreases when below
- OTP stock release: Farmers authorize releases remotely via 6-digit OTP (eliminates 45km travel)
- e-NWR PSL limit: ₹75 lakh per borrower (vs ₹50 lakh for paper receipts)
